> EFF members around the world drive the movement for Internet freedom, and ensure technology users everywhere have a seasoned advocate that is ready for action. Together we are standing up for online privacy, the free exchange of ideas, and a world in which the public’s interests come before corporations and politicians. A better digital future is possible with your help.


> Over 30,000 EFF donors around the world power the movement for Internet freedom. Our activism, technology development, policy analysis, and impact litigation is only possible with broad support from the public. We are proud that the majority of EFF’s funding comes from ordinary individuals, and over 80% of that funding consists of donations under $10,000. Direct contributions from businesses of any size comprised just 6% of our total public support.
